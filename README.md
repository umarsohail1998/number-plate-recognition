## Number Plate Detection with YOLO

This repository contains code and instructions for training a YOLO model to detect number plates using a custom dataset. The dataset used in this project is from Roboflow's License Plate Recognition dataset.

### Installation

First, ensure that you have the necessary libraries installed. The primary library used for YOLO model training and inference is `ultralytics`.

To install the required library, run:

```bash
pip install ultralytics
```

### Dataset Preparation

Download and unzip the dataset from Roboflow:

1. [Roboflow License Plate Recognition Dataset](https://universe.roboflow.com/roboflow-universe-projects/license-plate-recognition-rxg4e/dataset/4)

After downloading, unzip the dataset:

```bash
unzip numberplatedataset.zip
rm numberplatedataset.zip
```

Ensure the dataset is in the correct format for YOLO training and place it in the appropriate directory.

### Training the Model

You can either train a model from scratch using a pretrained YOLO model or resume training from a saved checkpoint.

#### 1. Train from Scratch

To start training from scratch, first, load a pretrained model and then train using your custom dataset:

```python
from ultralytics import YOLO

# Load a pretrained YOLO model
model = YOLO("yolov8n.pt")  # Uncomment to load a pretrained model

# Train the model from scratch
results = model.train(
    data="data.yaml", 
    epochs=100, 
    imgsz=640, 
    device=[0], 
    workers=16, 
    batch=64
)
```

#### 2. Resume Training from a Checkpoint

If you have previously trained a model and want to resume, load the last saved checkpoint:

```python
from ultralytics import YOLO

# Load a model from the last saved checkpoint
model = YOLO("runs/detect/train/weights/best.pt")  # Path to your trained model's weights

# Resume training from the checkpoint
results = model.train(
    data="data.yaml", 
    epochs=100, 
    imgsz=640, 
    device=[0], 
    resume=True, 
    workers=16, 
    batch=64
)
```

### Making Predictions

After training, you can use the trained model to make predictions on new images:

```python
from ultralytics import YOLO

# Load the trained YOLO model
model = YOLO("runs/detect/train/weights/best.pt")  # Path to your trained model's weights

# Make predictions on a new image
prediction_results = model("/content/cropped_image_441_416.jpg")  # Replace with your image path
```

### Visualizing Results

To visualize the prediction results, especially in a Google Colab environment, use:

```python
from google.colab.patches import cv2_imshow
import cv2

# Display the image with bounding boxes in Colab
cv2_imshow(prediction_results[0].plot())  # Uncomment to visualize predictions
```
